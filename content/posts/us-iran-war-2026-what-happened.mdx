## What Happened

At approximately 9:27 AM local time (06:27 GMT), explosions were reported across Tehran. Iran's Fars news agency confirmed multiple strikes in the capital, with smoke rising from central areas including University Street, Jomhouri Square, and near the IRGC headquarters.

**Key facts:**

- **Israel** announced a "pre-emptive strike" with Defense Minister Katz declaring a state of emergency
- **Trump** confirmed "major combat operations" via an 8-minute video on Truth Social
- The operation was codenamed **"Operation Epic Fury"** (US) and **"Roar of the Lion"** (Israel)
- Strikes hit **Tehran, Isfahan, Qom, Kermanshah, Karaj, Tabriz**, and Lorestan province
- Approximately **7 missiles** struck near the offices of Supreme Leader Khamenei
- Khamenei was reportedly **not in Tehran**, having relocated to a secure location

## Trump's Stated Objectives

1. **Destroy Iran's missile capabilities** — "raze their missile industry to the ground"
2. **Annihilate Iran's navy** — targeting IRGC naval forces
3. **Disrupt Iran-backed armed groups** across the region
4. **Prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons**

He warned Iran's military: lay down your weapons for amnesty, or face "certain death." To the Iranian people: "Take your government. It's yours."

## Iran's Response

Iran immediately retaliated:

- **Missiles launched at northern Israel**
- **Attacks on US military facilities** in Bahrain (5th Fleet), Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, and UAE
- **IRGC Navy** claimed to have struck a US combat support ship
- Hezbollah and Houthi forces activated across the region

Iran called the strikes an act of aggression violating international law, while emphasizing it targeted US military facilities — not civilians.

## Casualties So Far

- **Iran:** 40+ civilians killed in Minab
- **Israel:** 5 killed, 3 injured from Iranian retaliation
- **US:** Not yet confirmed

## Pre-emptive vs. Preventive: A Legal Distinction

- **Israeli media:** "pre-emptive strike" — implying an imminent threat
- **International agencies (AFP):** "preventive strike" — eliminating a future capability

The distinction matters for international law. Pre-emptive strikes have more legal justification; preventive strikes are far more controversial.

## What Comes Next

1. **How long will operations last?** US sources suggest days, not hours
2. **Will Iran close the Hormuz Strait?** This would devastate global energy markets
3. **What happens to Iranian leadership?** Trump's rhetoric suggests regime change ambitions
4. **How will Russia and China respond?** Both have strategic interests in Iran
5. **Will this spread?** Proxy forces in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, and Syria are already mobilizing
