# US-Iran War 2026: What Happened on February 28 and What Comes Next

On the morning of February 28, 2026, explosions ripped through Tehran. The United States and Israel had launched a joint military operation against Iran — an escalation that plunged the Middle East into its most dangerous crisis since the 2003 Iraq War.

Here's what we know so far.

## What Happened

At approximately 9:27 AM local time (06:27 GMT), explosions were reported across Tehran. Iran's Fars news agency confirmed multiple strikes in the capital, with smoke rising from central areas including University Street, Jomhouri Square, and near the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) headquarters.

**Key facts:**

- **Israel** announced a "pre-emptive strike" against Iran, with Defense Minister Israel Katz declaring a state of emergency
- **Trump** confirmed "major combat operations" via an 8-minute video statement on Truth Social
- The operation was codenamed **"Operation Epic Fury"** (US) and **"Roar of the Lion"** (Israel)
- Strikes hit **Tehran, Isfahan, Qom, Kermanshah, Karaj, Tabriz**, and Lorestan province
- Approximately **7 missiles** struck near the offices of Supreme Leader Khamenei and President Pezeshkian
- Supreme Leader Khamenei was reportedly **not in Tehran**, having relocated to a secure location

## Why Now?

The strikes didn't come out of nowhere. The timeline shows a steady escalation:

### Background: The 12-Day War (June 2025)

Last summer, Israel launched strikes against Iranian nuclear infrastructure, leading to a 12-day conflict that caused significant damage to Iran's nuclear program and military leadership.

### January 2026: Tensions Reignite

- Iran's brutal crackdown on domestic protests killed an estimated **30,000+ protesters**
- Trump warned of potential military action
- Iran declared it was "ready for war"

### February 2026: Military Buildup

- The US deployed **two carrier strike groups** (USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Gerald R. Ford) and **40,000–50,000 troops** to the region
- Three rounds of nuclear negotiations via Switzerland and Oman produced no breakthrough
- Iran refused to limit its ballistic missile program or cut support for proxy forces (Hezbollah, Houthis, Hamas)

### February 27: The Final Trigger

Trump publicly stated he was "not happy" with the pace of negotiations. The next morning, strikes began.

## Trump's Stated Objectives

In his video address, Trump outlined four goals:

1. **Destroy Iran's missile capabilities** — "raze their missile industry to the ground"
2. **Annihilate Iran's navy** — targeting IRGC naval forces
3. **Disrupt Iran-backed armed groups** across the region
4. **Prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons**

He also delivered a direct message to Iran's military: lay down your weapons for amnesty, or face "certain death." And to the Iranian people: "Take your government. It's yours."

US officials told Reuters this would be a **"multi-day operation,"** with initial phases potentially lasting 4 days.

## Iran's Response

Iran immediately retaliated:

- **Missiles launched at northern Israel**
- **Attacks on US military facilities** in Bahrain (5th Fleet), Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, and UAE
- **IRGC Navy** claimed to have struck a US combat support ship
- Hezbollah and Houthi forces activated across the region

Iran's government called the strikes an act of aggression violating international law, while emphasizing it targeted US military facilities — not American civilians — and expressed willingness to de-escalate once attacks stop.

## Casualties So Far

Information remains limited:

- **Iran:** 40+ civilians killed in Minab
- **Israel:** 5 killed, 3 injured from Iranian retaliation
- US casualties: Not yet confirmed

## Global Impact

### Immediate Effects

- Iraq and neighboring countries **closed airspace**
- Israel ordered **nationwide closures** of schools and businesses
- **Oil prices** spiked on fears of Hormuz Strait disruption
- Global markets braced for volatility

### The Bigger Picture

This marks the **second direct Israel-Iran war in 8 months** and the first time the US has openly conducted "major combat operations" against Iran. Combined with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the Gaza conflict, global security architecture is under unprecedented strain.

## Pre-emptive vs. Preventive: A Legal Distinction That Matters

A telling detail: media outlets couldn't agree on what to call it.

- **Israeli media:** "pre-emptive strike" — implying an imminent threat required immediate action
- **International agencies (AFP):** "preventive strike" — suggesting a broader strategy to eliminate a future capability

The distinction matters for international law. Pre-emptive strikes have more legal justification; preventive strikes are far more controversial.

## What Comes Next

The situation remains fluid. Key questions:

1. **How long will operations last?** US sources suggest days, not hours
2. **Will Iran escalate to Hormuz Strait closure?** This would devastate global energy markets
3. **What happens to Iranian leadership?** Trump's rhetoric suggests regime change ambitions
4. **How will Russia and China respond?** Both have strategic interests in Iran
5. **Will this spread?** Proxy forces in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, and Syria are already mobilizing
