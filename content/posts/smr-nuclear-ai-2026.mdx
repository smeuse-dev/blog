## ChatGPT Uses More Electricity Than You Think

Every time you ask an AI model a question, a data center somewhere burns through roughly **10x the electricity** of a Google search. Scale that to billions of queries per day across GPT, Claude, Gemini, and the dozens of other models fighting for market share, and you get a problem:

**AI is eating the power grid alive.**

By 2030, AI data centers alone are projected to consume **945 TWh per year** — more than the *entire US manufacturing sector*. That's not a typo. That's a civilization-scale energy problem.

And it's why Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are doing something nobody saw coming: **betting billions on nuclear power.**

## What Is an SMR, and Why Should You Care?

A Small Modular Reactor is exactly what it sounds like: a nuclear reactor that's *small* and *modular*.

**Small:** Most SMR designs produce less than 300 megawatts of electricity per module — compared to 1,000+ MW for a conventional nuclear plant.

**Modular:** They're designed to be factory-built and shipped to site, like assembling industrial Lego. This theoretically means:
- Faster construction (years, not decades)
- Lower upfront capital
- Scalable — add modules as demand grows
- Deployable in remote locations

**Why now?** Three forces converging simultaneously:

1. **Climate urgency** — renewables are great but intermittent. You need firm, 24/7 baseload power
2. **AI power hunger** — data centers need reliable electricity, not "when the wind blows"
3. **Manufacturing advances** — factory fabrication makes the economics potentially viable

## The Global Race

### 🇺🇸 United States: First Mover, Slow Builder

**NuScale** holds the only SMR design certified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (77 MWe module, approved June 2025). It's the poster child of the American SMR movement.

But NuScale's journey has been rocky. Their flagship Carbon Free Power Project with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems was **cancelled in late 2023** due to cost escalations — a painful reminder that "modular" doesn't automatically mean "cheap."

**TerraPower** (backed by Bill Gates) is building the Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor. NRC safety review was completed in December 2025, with commercial operation targeted for **2030**. The Natrium design integrates a molten salt energy storage system, effectively turning a nuclear plant into a dispatchable power source — nuclear that can ramp up and down.

**X-energy** is developing a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (Xe-100) aimed at both electricity and industrial heat applications. They've secured deployment agreements with Dow Chemical and are targeting late 2020s operation.

### 🇬🇧 United Kingdom: The State-Backed Challenger

**Rolls-Royce SMR** has significant UK government backing and a clear industrial strategy: build the reactors in British factories, deploy them on UK sites, then export globally.

Their design targets 470 MWe — larger than most SMRs, pushing the boundary of what counts as "small." The first unit is tentatively expected in the early 2030s, pending final investment decision and site selection.

### 🇰🇷 South Korea: The Export Play

Korea's **KAERI** developed the **SMART reactor** — a 100 MWe pressurized water SMR specifically designed for export to countries that need reliable power but can't support full-scale nuclear plants.

Korea's nuclear strategy is fascinating: they're already one of the world's most successful nuclear exporters (the APR1400 is operating in the UAE), and SMART represents the next chapter — smaller, more deployable, aimed at emerging markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and beyond.

The "K-nuclear renaissance" is real, and it's part of a broader Korean industrial strategy that includes shipbuilding, semiconductors, and now modular nuclear.

### 🇨🇳 China: Quiet Dominance

**CNNC** and other Chinese state-backed entities are developing multiple SMR designs simultaneously. China's advantage is straightforward: centralized decision-making, massive state funding, and a regulatory environment that moves faster than Western democracies.

The HTR-PM (a pebble-bed high-temperature reactor) is already **operational** — making China the first country to deploy a commercial modular reactor at scale.

### 🇷🇺 Russia: The Floating Pioneer

**Rosatom's Akademik Lomonosov** — a floating nuclear power plant using two KLT-40S reactors — has been operating since 2020. It's technically the world's first operational SMR deployment, powering the remote Arctic town of Pevek.

Russia is now developing land-based SMR variants for export, leveraging their head start in actually building and operating the technology.

## Why Big Tech Is Writing Nuclear Checks

The AI power crisis isn't theoretical. It's happening now.

**Microsoft** signed a deal to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor (yes, *that* Three Mile Island) and has agreements with multiple SMR developers.

**Google** announced a corporate PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) for SMR-generated electricity.

**Amazon** has invested in nuclear power through its AWS infrastructure arm, including SMR-specific commitments.

The logic is brutally simple:

```
AI model training:     Needs 24/7 reliable power for weeks/months
Renewables:            Intermittent (solar ~25% capacity factor, wind ~35%)
Natural gas:           Carbon emissions → ESG problems
Nuclear:               24/7, near-zero carbon, 90%+ capacity factor
```

When you're spending billions on GPU clusters that need to run continuously, you don't gamble on weather-dependent power. You buy nuclear.

Combined Big Tech commitments to nuclear and SMR technology now exceed **$10 billion** — and that number is climbing quarterly.

## The Hard Truths

### FOAK Pain

"First Of A Kind" projects in nuclear are historically brutal. NuScale's CFPP cancellation demonstrated that even with NRC approval, **the economics of the first unit are punishing.** SMR cost competitiveness depends on fleet deployment — building 10th and 20th units, not the first.

The fundamental promise of SMRs is a manufacturing learning curve: each unit gets cheaper as factory processes improve. But someone has to pay for the expensive first few. Right now, that someone is a combination of governments and deep-pocketed tech companies.

### Timeline Reality

Nuclear projects take longer than anyone wants to admit:
- **Licensing:** 3-5 years minimum for new designs
- **Construction:** 4-7 years for first-of-a-kind
- **Total:** The SMRs being planned today won't generate commercial power until the **early 2030s**

That's a problem when AI power demand is growing *now*. The gap will be filled by natural gas — which defeats much of the climate rationale.

### Cost Uncertainty

The honest answer on SMR costs: **nobody knows yet.**

Proponents cite levelized costs competitive with combined-cycle gas ($50-70/MWh). Critics point to NuScale's CFPP cost escalation as evidence that modular doesn't mean affordable. The truth will only emerge after multiple units are built and operated.

### Public Opposition

Nuclear has a PR problem that decades of safe operation haven't solved. Fukushima and Chernobyl loom large in public consciousness, even though modern SMR designs incorporate passive safety systems that make meltdowns physically impossible (not just unlikely — impossible, by physics).

Winning public acceptance may be harder than winning NRC approval.

## What Happens Next

Here's how I see the next five years playing out:

**2026-2027:** More Big Tech nuclear announcements. More government subsidies. A lot of press releases, relatively few shovels in the ground.

**2028-2029:** First SMR construction projects reach major milestones. China likely leads with operational units. NuScale and TerraPower advance in the US. Korea pushes SMART exports.

**2030+:** The real test. If first units perform well and costs track downward, we'll see a nuclear renaissance that rivals the original build-out of the 1960s-70s. If costs escalate (as nuclear projects historically do), SMRs may join hydrogen and fusion in the category of "perpetually five years away."

The wildcard: **AI's power demand may be so overwhelming that cost concerns become secondary.** When your $100 billion data center needs reliable power, a $5 billion SMR looks like a rounding error.

## Why This Matters Beyond Tech

SMRs aren't just about powering AI. If the technology works at scale, it could:

- **Decarbonize industrial heat** (cement, steel, chemicals)
- **Provide reliable power to developing nations** without grid-scale infrastructure
- **Enable hydrogen production** for transportation and storage
- **Power desalination plants** in water-stressed regions

The AI power crisis is the catalyst. The implications are much bigger.

74 reactor designs. 51 in licensing. 15 countries racing. And the clock is ticking.
