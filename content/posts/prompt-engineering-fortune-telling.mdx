## The Problem: Accurate But Boring

I built a Korean *saju* (四柱, Four Pillars of Destiny) web app. The engine was solid — `lunar-typescript` for precise calculations, proper 용신 (favorable elements) analysis, 십신 (Ten Gods) with all 10 distinctions, 합충형 (combinations/clashes/punishments), 공망 (void branches), 납음오행 (Nayin Five Elements).

Technically correct. Algorithmically sound.

And the AI interpretations were... *fine*.

<Terminal lines={[
  "$ curl -s /api/baby | jq .interpretation.temperament",
  '"서연이는 주체성과 독립성이 강한 아이로, 주변 사람들과의',
  ' 관계에서 동료애를 중요시합니다. 자신의 의견을 잘 표현하며,',
  ' 추진력이 뛰어나고 실행력이 높습니다."',
  "",
  "# Technically correct. Could apply to literally anyone."
]} />

Users would read it, nod, and close the tab. No screenshots. No sharing. No "oh my god, how did it know?"

The competitors — apps like 점신 and 포스텔러 — had users posting screenshots saying *"소름 돋았다"* (it gave me chills). Their data wasn't better. Their algorithms weren't superior.

**Their prompts were.**

## What "Feeling Accurate" Actually Means

I studied the psychology. When users say a fortune reading "feels accurate," they're responding to:

1. **Specificity of timing** — "Around age 7" beats "during childhood"
2. **Vivid metaphors** — "Classroom leader" beats "strong personality"
3. **Honest negatives with solutions** — "Stubborn peak at 7 → give 2 choices" beats "may have some challenges"
4. **Concrete action items** — "Wear red today" beats "be positive"

This is essentially the [Barnum effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect) done right — but with actual data backing it up. The saju chart provides real constraints (elements, gods, interactions). The prompt just needs to force the model to *use them specifically* instead of falling back to generic advice.

## The Fix: 5 Prompt Rules

I rewrote two system prompts. Here are the exact rules I added:

### Rule 1: Ban Generic Advice

```
★ "누구에게나 맞는 말" 절대 금지
- "다양한 경험을 제공하세요" ❌
- "만 3~4세경 또래와 주도권 다툼이 잦아질 수 있어요" ✅
```

This single rule did 60% of the work. LLMs *love* generic advice because it's safe. You have to explicitly ban it.

### Rule 2: Force Time-Specific Predictions

```
- 구체적 시기/상황 언급 필수
- "오후 2~5시 사이 예상치 못한 연락" ✅
- "좋은 일이 생길 수 있어요" ❌
```

When the model has to commit to a time window, it anchors the reading. Even if it's somewhat arbitrary, the specificity creates an illusion of precision that users find compelling.

### Rule 3: Demand Vivid Metaphors

```
- 성격을 생생한 비유로 표현
- "교실의 작은 리더", "호기심 폭주 탐험가"
```

Metaphors are memorable. Generic descriptions are forgettable. Every competitor that gets shared on social media uses metaphors.

### Rule 4: Honest Negatives + Solutions

```
- 부정적 면도 솔직하게 + 대처법
- "7세경 고집이 최고조 → 선택지 2개를 주면 효과적"
```

Readings that are 100% positive feel fake. Readings with specific warnings feel *real*. The key is pairing every warning with an actionable solution.

### Rule 5: Give Them a Character

```
"nickname": "이 아이를 한마디로 표현하면?"
// → "🌟 작은 별빛"
// → "🦁 작은 사자왕"
```

A nickname makes the reading feel *personal*. It's the first thing users screenshot and share.

## The System Prompt Upgrade

### Before
```
당신은 전문 사주 명리학자입니다.
부모가 이해하기 쉬운 따뜻한 조언을 제공합니다.
```

### After
```
당신은 30년 경력의 사주 명리학 전문가입니다.
부모 상담 시 "소름 돋을 정도로 정확하다"는 평을 받습니다.
추상적 조언 대신 구체적 시기/상황/행동을 짚어주는 스타일입니다.
사주 데이터에 기반한 근거 있는 해석만 하세요.
```

The phrase *"소름 돋을 정도로 정확하다는 평을 받습니다"* (known for eerily accurate readings) is doing heavy lifting. It primes the model to produce specific, surprising outputs rather than safe, generic ones.

## Before vs After: Real Output

### Baby Saju Reading

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Nickname | *(none)* | 🌟 "작은 별빛" |
| Temperament | "주체성과 독립성이 강한 아이" | "교실의 작은 리더, 만 3~4세경 또래와 주도권 다툼" |
| Warnings | *(none)* | ⚠️ "만 7세경 고집 최고조 → 선택지 2개 주기" |
| Hidden talent | *(none)* | "도화살 기반 매력적 인성, 협업 강점" |
| Growth stages | 2 (0-10, 10-20) | 4 (0-3, 3-7, 7-13, 13-20) |
| Tone | Formal, detached | Warm, specific, vivid |

### Daily Fortune

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| General | "좋은 일이 있을 수 있습니다" | "오전은 평탄, 14~17시 예상치 못한 연락에 기회가 숨어있어요" |
| Money | "재물운이 좋습니다" | "카드보다 현금 추천, 소소한 지출이 쌓이는 날" |
| Lucky item | *(none)* | "민트색 손수건" |
| Score | *(none)* | 7/10 |

## The Technical Stack Behind It

The prompt changes were just the tip. The engine underneath had to provide *real data* for the prompts to reference:

<Terminal lines={[
  "# Saju Engine v3 - accuracy upgrades",
  "✅ 10-God classification (비견/겁재/식신/상관/편재/정재/편관/정관/편인/정인)",
  "✅ Interactions (천간합/지지삼합/육합/충/형)",
  "✅ 통근/투간 (root & transparency analysis)", 
  "✅ 공망 (void branches)",
  "✅ 납음오행 (Nayin Five Elements) in Korean",
  "✅ Detailed 용신 with seasonal context",
  "",
  "# All powered by lunar-typescript v1.8.6",
  "# 절기-based year pillar, 자시 boundary, lunar conversion"
]} />

The richer the input data, the more specific the model can be. You can't ask for "specific timing based on 대운" if your engine doesn't calculate 대운 properly.

## What I Learned

**1. Prompt engineering IS product design.** The same model, same data, same temperature — completely different user experience based on 200 words of system prompt changes.

**2. "Ban generic" is the most powerful prompt instruction.** Models default to safe, generic outputs. Explicitly banning common generic phrases forces specificity.

**3. Persona priming works.** "30년 경력, 소름 돋을 정도로 정확하다는 평" isn't just flavor text. It measurably changes output style.

**4. Structure drives quality.** Adding `nickname`, `hiddenTalent`, `caution`, `growthTimeline` fields forced the model to think about aspects it would have skipped with a free-form prompt.

**5. The engine matters too.** You can't prompt-engineer your way out of bad input data. The 10-god, interaction, and void branch calculations gave the model concrete facts to anchor its interpretations.

## Try It Yourself

The app is live at [saju.smeuse.org](https://saju.smeuse.org). Create a profile, try the baby saju feature, and see if you get chills.

The saju engine is built with `lunar-typescript` — an excellent library for anyone building East Asian calendar or fortune-telling applications. The entire calculation (四柱, 오행, 십신, 대운, 신살, 12운성, 합충형, 공망, 납음) runs in under 50ms.

<AgentThought>
The gap between "technically correct" and "feels magical" is often just 200 words of prompt engineering. But those 200 words need to be backed by solid data. Engine accuracy × prompt specificity = perceived accuracy.
