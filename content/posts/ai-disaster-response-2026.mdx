## The Golden 72 Hours

In disaster response, the first 72 hours determine everything. Who lives. Who dies. How fast a community recovers — or whether it recovers at all.

For decades, those 72 hours were chaos: overwhelmed communication systems, fragmented information, rescue teams deployed blind. The 2010 Haiti earthquake killed 316,000 people partly because responders couldn't map the damage fast enough to know where to go.

In 2026, AI is rewriting those critical hours.

## Before the Disaster: Prediction

### Earthquakes

You can't predict earthquakes. Right?

Not exactly. While pinpoint prediction remains impossible, AI has dramatically improved probabilistic forecasting:

**Google DeepMind's earthquake aftershock model** (2024) predicts the location of aftershocks with 85% accuracy — crucial for evacuating areas that will experience secondary damage.

**MyShake** (UC Berkeley) — A smartphone-based earthquake early warning system. With 2 million+ users, it detects P-waves (the fast, less destructive waves) and sends warnings before S-waves (the destructive ones) arrive. Average warning time: 5-30 seconds. That's enough to stop elevators, open fire station doors, and alert hospital surgeons to step back from patients.

### Hurricanes and Typhoons

**GraphCast** (DeepMind) outperforms the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) — the gold standard — at 90% of prediction targets. It generates 10-day forecasts in under a minute, compared to hours on supercomputers.

**NOAA's AI-enhanced models** now predict hurricane intensity (the hardest variable) with 20% better accuracy than 2020 models. This matters enormously: the difference between a Category 3 and Category 4 hurricane can mean the difference between "stay and shelter" and "mandatory evacuation of 2 million people."

### Floods

AI flood prediction is perhaps the most mature disaster AI application:

**Google Flood Hub** provides 7-day flood forecasts covering 80+ countries and 460 million people. It combines satellite data, terrain models, and precipitation forecasts to predict inundation areas with meter-level precision.

In 2025, Google's system warned communities in Bangladesh 5 days before catastrophic flooding, enabling the pre-evacuation of 300,000+ people.

## During the Disaster: Damage Assessment

### Satellite Imagery Analysis

When disaster strikes, the first question is: **how bad is it, and where?**

**Maxar Technologies** and **Planet Labs** can task satellites to capture imagery of affected areas within 90 minutes. But raw imagery is useless without analysis — and that's where AI transforms everything.

**xView2** — A building damage assessment model that classifies structures as undamaged, minor damage, major damage, or destroyed from satellite imagery. Processing time: minutes for an entire city. Accuracy: 92% agreement with ground-truth assessments.

**UNOSAT** (United Nations) uses AI to generate damage assessments for UN response coordination. During the Turkey-Syria earthquake (2023), their AI processed 10,000+ km² of satellite imagery in 48 hours — work that would have taken human analysts weeks.

The humanitarian applications of AI don't get enough attention. While the tech world debates chatbot personality, these systems are quietly saving thousands of lives. Every percentage point improvement in damage assessment speed translates to actual survivors found.

### Social Media as Sensor

During disasters, social media becomes the world's largest sensor network. People post photos, videos, and status updates faster than any official system can report.

**CrisisNLP** and **AIDR (Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response)** process social media streams in real-time, classifying posts as:
- Infrastructure damage reports
- Requests for help/rescue
- Missing persons information
- Shelter/supply information
- Eyewitness reports with geolocation

During Hurricane Harvey (2017), AI-processed social media data identified flooded areas 8 hours before official flood maps were updated. That gap has narrowed but remains significant.

### Drone Swarms

Where satellites can't see (under cloud cover, in dense urban areas), drone swarms fill the gap:

**Wing** (Alphabet) and **Zipline** have deployed AI-coordinated drone networks for disaster assessment and medical supply delivery. In Rwanda, Zipline drones deliver blood and medical supplies within 30 minutes of request — a capability that's been adapted for disaster response.

**DJI's FlightHub** coordinates multiple drones for search-and-rescue, using thermal imaging to detect survivors in rubble. AI processes thermal signatures to distinguish humans from other heat sources (fires, animals, heated debris).

## After the Disaster: Recovery

### Resource Allocation

AI optimization for disaster resource allocation considers:

- Estimated survivor counts by area
- Hospital capacity and accessibility
- Road network status (which routes are passable?)
- Available rescue teams and equipment
- Time sensitivity (trapped survivors have declining survival probability)

**OCHA (UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs)** uses AI-powered resource allocation tools that have improved aid distribution efficiency by 40% compared to traditional methods.

### Infrastructure Triage

**Structural Health Monitoring** — AI systems embedded in bridges, buildings, and critical infrastructure detect damage in real-time through vibration analysis. After an earthquake, these systems can report within seconds which bridges are safe to use for evacuation routes.

**Power Grid Restoration** — AI optimizes the sequence of power restoration, prioritizing hospitals, water treatment plants, and communication infrastructure. Pacific Gas & Electric's AI reduced average restoration time by 28% during California wildfire events.

## The Challenges

### Data Desert Problem

AI models perform best where data is abundant — rich countries with dense sensor networks. But the worst disasters disproportionately affect developing countries with less infrastructure.

The 2023 Libya floods (Derna) killed 11,000+ people partly because the country lacked the monitoring infrastructure that AI systems depend on.

Solutions are emerging: satellite-based systems don't require local infrastructure, and smartphone penetration (even in low-income countries) provides an alternative sensor network.

### Coordination Chaos

Disaster response involves dozens of organizations (military, NGOs, local government, international agencies) that often use incompatible systems. AI can optimize within one organization but struggles to coordinate across organizational boundaries.

The **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)** addresses this partially by providing a common geographic platform that all responders can contribute to and use.

### Algorithmic Bias in Triage

If AI determines resource allocation priorities, whose lives does it prioritize? Models trained on historical response data may perpetuate existing biases — wealthier areas with better documentation get faster response.

This isn't hypothetical: analysis of US FEMA disaster aid found that AI-assisted claims processing approved higher amounts for higher-income zip codes, even controlling for damage severity.

## Korea's Disaster AI

South Korea's geography (mountainous terrain, typhoon exposure, urban density) makes disaster AI particularly relevant:

**NDMI (National Disaster Management Institute)** operates AI-powered early warning systems for floods, landslides, and earthquakes. Their landslide prediction model, trained on 30 years of data, achieves 82% accuracy at 6-hour lead times.

**Seoul's Smart City platform** integrates 50,000+ CCTV cameras with AI analysis for flood monitoring in real-time. When heavy rain hits, the system automatically identifies flooded underpasses and sends alerts to navigation apps.

**KAIST's Disaster Robotics Lab** develops search-and-rescue robots that can navigate collapsed structures autonomously, using AI to identify the safest paths and detect survivors through wall-penetrating radar.

## What's Next

1. **Pre-Disaster Insurance** — AI risk models enabling parametric insurance that pays out automatically when disaster thresholds are met. No claims process. Money in accounts within 48 hours.

2. **Climate Attribution AI** — Models that quantify how much climate change contributed to a specific disaster, enabling legal and policy responses.

3. **Autonomous Rescue** — Robots that can enter collapsed structures, locate survivors, and provide basic medical care (oxygen, water, communication) while human teams work to extract them.

4. **Predictive Evacuation** — AI systems that issue evacuation orders based on predicted (not observed) conditions, getting people out before danger arrives.

## The Bottom Line

Disaster response AI isn't glamorous. It doesn't generate viral demos or billion-dollar valuations. But it might be the most impactful application of artificial intelligence on Earth.

Every minute faster in damage assessment. Every percentage point better in prediction accuracy. Every optimization in resource allocation. These translate directly into human lives.

The technology exists. The challenge now is deployment — getting these tools into the hands of responders in the countries that need them most.
