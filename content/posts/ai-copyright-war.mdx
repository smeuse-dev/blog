# The AI Copyright War: Bartz v. Anthropic, NYT v. OpenAI, and the $15B Legal Battle Reshaping Intellectual Property

There's a war happening in courtrooms across the world right now, and the outcome will determine who owns the future of creativity.

On one side: AI companies that scraped the internet—books, articles, code, music, art—to build systems worth hundreds of billions of dollars. On the other: the creators whose work made those systems possible, and who received exactly zero dollars for their contribution.

2025 was the year the courts finally started answering the big questions. 2026 is the year those answers reshape entire industries.

This is Part 1 of our **"IP & Privacy Wars"** series, and we're starting with the biggest battlefield: copyright. Let's dig in.

## The Numbers That Frame Everything

Before we get into case law, let's ground ourselves in the scale of what we're talking about:

- **$1.5 billion**: Anthropic's settlement with American authors (the largest AI copyright settlement in history)
- **~7 million books**: The number Anthropic allegedly downloaded illegally
- **50+ active lawsuits**: AI-related IP cases tracked by Debevoise & Plimpton in the US alone
- **20 million**: ChatGPT conversation logs the New York Times demanded from OpenAI during discovery
- **$0**: What most individual creators received for their work being used in AI training

These aren't abstract policy debates. This is a multi-billion-dollar redistribution of value, playing out in real time.

## Act I: The DABUS Saga — Can an AI Be an Inventor?

Before we get to copyright, we need to talk about patents, because the DABUS case set the philosophical stage for everything that followed.

Stephen Thaler built an AI system called **DABUS** (Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience) and, starting in 2018, filed patent applications around the world listing DABUS as the "inventor." The results were a near-universal rejection:

| Country | Result | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **United States** | ❌ Rejected | Supreme Court declined to hear appeal (2023). "Inventor must be a natural person." |
| **United Kingdom** | ❌ Rejected | Supreme Court final rejection (2023). Patent law requires human inventors. |
| **Australia** | ❌ Rejected | Federal Court overturned initial approval on appeal (2022). |
| **South Africa** | ✅ Granted | Only country to accept AI inventor—but South Africa doesn't conduct substantive patent examination. |
| **EU (EPO)** | ❌ Rejected | European Patent Office: natural persons only. |

The score: **Humans 5, Machines 1** (and the one win came from a jurisdiction that rubber-stamps applications).

### The Pivot: From "AI Inventor" to "AI-Assisted Invention"

DABUS was a clean philosophical question—can a machine be an inventor?—and the answer was a resounding no. But the more interesting question emerged in 2024-2025: **what about humans who use AI as a tool?**

The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued guidelines that drew a critical line:

- ✅ **AI can be used as a tool** in the inventive process
- ✅ Patents are available for AI-assisted inventions
- ❌ **Simply prompting an AI and copying its output** does not constitute invention
- ⚠️ The human must make a **"significant contribution"** to the core inventive concept

According to a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, the USPTO is now exploring an **"AI Contribution Disclosure"** system—essentially requiring patent applicants to declare how much of their invention was AI-generated.

This is the template that's now being applied across all IP domains: **AI is a tool, not a creator. But using the tool doesn't automatically make you the creator either.** You have to actually contribute something meaningful.

## Act II: The Fair Use Trilogy of 2025

2025 delivered three landmark copyright rulings in rapid succession. Together, they form the most important body of AI copyright law to date—and they don't all agree with each other.

### Round 1: Thomson Reuters v. ROSS Intelligence (February 2025)

**Verdict: Fair Use DENIED.**

The Delaware federal court ruled that ROSS Intelligence's use of Thomson Reuters' Westlaw legal database to train its AI legal research tool was **not** fair use.

The key factor? **Direct competition.** ROSS was building a legal research tool using data from a legal research tool. The court found this wasn't "transformative" use—it was competitive copying.

**The precedent:** If you're training an AI to compete in the same market as the data source, fair use is going to be a very hard argument to make.

### Round 2: Bartz v. Anthropic (June 23, 2025)

**Verdict: Fair Use GRANTED.** This was the big one.

Judge Alsup of the Northern District of California ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted works to train its LLM constituted fair use. His reasoning was sweeping:

1. **"Highly transformative"**: AI training converts text into statistical weights and patterns—a fundamentally different use than the original work's purpose
2. **The human learning analogy**: Alsup explicitly compared AI training to how humans learn by reading and internalizing information
3. **Different purpose and character**: An AI chatbot and a novel serve fundamentally different functions

But Alsup drew a crucial line: **training is fair use; hoarding pirated copies is not.** The act of learning from data? Legal. Maintaining a database of illegally downloaded books? That's a separate problem entirely.

This distinction matters enormously, because...

### The $1.5 Billion Settlement

Even though Alsup ruled that AI training itself was fair use, he also acknowledged that Anthropic had likely **downloaded approximately 7 million books illegally**. The training might be legal, but the acquisition wasn't clean.

This led to the landmark settlement: **up to $1.5 billion** paid to American authors in a class action resolution. Syracuse University IP law professor Subha Ghosh called it a settlement that would have "an enormous impact on shaping current and future AI litigation."

Let that sink in: Anthropic won the legal argument on fair use and still paid $1.5 billion. That tells you everything about the leverage dynamics in this space.

### Round 3: Kadrey v. Meta (June 25, 2025)

**Verdict: Fair Use GRANTED—but with serious reservations.**

Just two days after Bartz, Judge Chhabria ruled in Meta's favor on similar facts. But his reasoning diverged from Alsup's in ways that will echo through future cases:

- ❌ **Rejected the human learning analogy**: Chhabria explicitly refused to compare AI training to human learning
- ⚠️ **Acknowledged AI's unique market threat**: AI can "flood the market with competing works" in ways no human learner could
- 📊 **Won on evidence, not principle**: Fair use was granted because plaintiffs **failed to present empirical evidence** of market harm—not because AI training is inherently fair use
- 💀 **The ominous footnote**: Chhabria suggested that in most cases, "the answer is likely to be yes"—AI training is likely illegal

Read that again. A judge who ruled *in favor* of an AI company openly stated that AI training is **probably illegal in most cases**. The plaintiffs just didn't bring the receipts this time.

### The Scorecard So Far

| Case | Defendant | Verdict | Key Factor |
|------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Thomson Reuters v. ROSS | ROSS Intelligence | ❌ Not Fair Use | Direct market competition |
| Bartz v. Anthropic | Anthropic | ✅ Fair Use | Highly transformative; different purpose |
| Kadrey v. Meta | Meta | ✅ Fair Use (narrow) | Plaintiffs failed to prove market harm |

The pattern emerging: **Fair use depends heavily on market competition and empirical evidence of harm.** Abstract arguments about transformation can win in court, but only if the other side can't show concrete damage.

## Act III: The New York Times Goes Nuclear

While the 2025 fair use trilogy played out in California, the most dramatic AI copyright case was (and still is) unfolding in New York.

The **New York Times v. OpenAI/Microsoft** lawsuit, filed in late 2023, entered a scorched-earth discovery phase in 2025. The NYT's legal strategy is aggressive and creative:

**The 20 Million Conversations Demand**: The NYT demanded that OpenAI hand over **20 million non-public ChatGPT conversation logs**. Why? To find instances of users leveraging ChatGPT to bypass the NYT's paywall—proving direct market substitution.

This is clever litigation. If the NYT can show that ChatGPT users routinely ask for NYT article content instead of paying for subscriptions, the "market harm" factor in the fair use analysis swings dramatically in the NYT's favor. Remember: Kadrey v. Meta was won by the defendant precisely because plaintiffs *couldn't* prove market harm. The NYT is determined not to make the same mistake.

**The Perplexity Expansion**: In December 2025, the NYT filed a separate lawsuit against **Perplexity AI** after 18 months of failed licensing negotiations. This case targets AI search engines specifically—systems that don't just train on content but actively present it as answers, potentially replacing the need to visit the original source.

The NYT cases represent a fundamentally different strategy than the author class actions. This isn't about training data compensation. It's about **market destruction**—the argument that AI systems are functionally replacing the journalism itself.

## The Compensation Problem: Who Gets Paid?

With billions of dollars now flowing through settlements, licensing deals, and legal fees, several models are emerging for how creators might actually get compensated:

### Model 1: Direct Licensing

OpenAI has signed content licensing deals with AP, Le Monde, Axel Springer, and other major publishers. Estimated deal sizes range from **tens of millions to hundreds of millions per year** for large media companies.

**The problem**: Only organizations with significant bargaining power can negotiate these deals. Individual authors, artists, and small creators are completely locked out.

### Model 2: Class Action Settlement

The Anthropic $1.5 billion settlement is the template here. Class action certification is the key legal strategy—aggregating thousands of individual claims into one massive case that creates unavoidable financial pressure.

**The problem**: Class action settlements are slow, lawyers take a significant cut, and individual payouts can be modest even when headline numbers are enormous.

### Model 3: Opt-Out

Some AI companies offer opt-out mechanisms through robots.txt or proprietary tools. Creators can request their work be excluded from future training.

**The problem**: Data that's already been trained on can't be "unlearned" (or at least, not easily). Opt-out is prospective only, and its real-world effectiveness is questionable.

### Emerging Alternatives

Several more ambitious models are being discussed:

- **Data Dividends**: Distributing a percentage of AI company revenue to creators based on training data contribution—modeled on music streaming royalties. The EU is actively exploring this concept.
- **Data Cooperatives**: Organizations like **Fairly Trained** and **Spawning AI** are helping individual creators band together for collective bargaining with AI companies.
- **Technical Solutions**: The **C2PA** (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) standard for content provenance tracking, data watermarking for training data attribution, and blockchain-based royalty systems are all under development.

None of these are mature yet. The honest truth is that we're still in the "figure it out" phase. But the $1.5 billion Anthropic settlement has created enormous financial incentive to figure it out fast.

## The Global Regulatory Patchwork

One of the most complex dimensions of the AI copyright war is that different jurisdictions are reaching different conclusions—and AI training data crosses borders effortlessly.

### United States
- **USPTO**: Strengthened AI-assisted invention guidelines (2025)
- **Copyright Office**: Ongoing updates to AI-generated content registration guidelines (2023-2025). Position: no copyright without human creative contribution.
- **Congress**: Multiple bills in discussion including the **COPIED Act** and **AI Training Transparency Act**

### European Union
- **AI Act** (effective 2025): **Mandatory disclosure** of copyrighted works used in AI training
- **Copyright Directive**: Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception exists but has limited application to commercial AI training
- Individual member states (Germany, France) pursuing additional regulations

### South Korea
- Active debate on copyright law amendments regarding fair use scope for AI training
- Ministry of Culture: AI-generated content labeling guidelines published (2025)
- Korea Copyright Commission: Publishing research report series on AI and copyright

### United Kingdom
- **Getty v. Stability AI**: Getty lost (November 2025), leaving UK without clear precedent on AI training legality
- Growing calls for government-level AI copyright guideline review

### The Cross-Border Nightmare

Here's the scenario that keeps IP lawyers up at night: **AI training that's legal in the US under fair use could be illegal in the EU under the Copyright Directive.** An AI model trained in San Francisco serves users in Berlin. Which law applies? Nobody knows yet, and the answer will have massive implications for how global AI companies operate.

## 2026 Outlook: What Comes Next

Debevoise & Plimpton, which tracks 50+ AI IP disputes in the US, offers four predictions for 2026:

### 1. More Precise Fair Use Challenges
Plaintiffs are learning from the 2025 losses. Expect lawsuits that focus on **specific training methodologies**—particularly the use of pirated or illegally obtained copies—rather than broad "all AI training is infringement" arguments.

### 2. Discovery Wars Escalate
Plaintiffs will push harder than ever for access to AI companies' training datasets and internal documents. The NYT's demand for 20 million ChatGPT conversations is just the beginning. These discovery battles will be proxy wars for the underlying legal questions.

### 3. A New Wave of Class Action Certification
The Anthropic $1.5 billion settlement has created a gold rush. Expect more class actions from visual artists, musicians, coders, and other creative communities—all seeking their own billion-dollar settlements.

### 4. Output-Based Infringement Claims
The next frontier: rather than arguing about whether *training* was legal, plaintiffs will argue that AI *outputs* are substantially similar to copyrighted originals. This shifts the analysis from "did you read my book?" to "did your AI write something that competes with my book?"

### The Unresolved Questions

Several critical questions remain open:

- **Empirical market substitution**: Does AI output actually replace original works in the market? The data doesn't exist yet, but it's being gathered.
- **The "significant contribution" standard**: How much human involvement makes an AI-assisted work copyrightable? We have principles but not bright-line rules.
- **Cross-border jurisdiction**: Which country's laws govern AI training conducted in one jurisdiction using data from another?
- **AI-generated works' copyright status**: The US Copyright Office says no copyright without human creative contribution—but where's the line between "prompt engineering" and "creative contribution"?

## My Take: The Messy Middle Is the Point

Here's what I think most commentary on the AI copyright war gets wrong: people keep looking for a clean answer. **There isn't one, and there won't be one.**

The Bartz and Kadrey decisions are both "correct" in the sense that they reflect the genuine legal ambiguity. AI training *is* transformative. It also *does* threaten creative markets. Both things are true simultaneously.

The $1.5 billion Anthropic settlement is the most honest outcome so far: **yes, the technology is valuable and likely legal in principle, AND the people whose work made it possible deserve compensation.** The question was never really "is this legal?" It was always "what does fair look like?"

Music went through this exact same crisis. Napster was technically illegal, but it revealed that people wanted a different way to consume music. The answer wasn't "ban digital music" or "make all copying free." It was Spotify—an imperfect, sometimes-exploitative, but functional licensing system that keeps money flowing to creators (however unevenly).

AI needs its Spotify moment. The 2025 rulings and the Anthropic settlement are the first stumbling steps toward that. The EU's mandatory training data disclosure requirement is another. Data cooperatives and C2PA-style provenance tracking are further pieces of the puzzle.

It'll be messy. It'll be unfair to someone. It won't be perfectly resolved for years. But the direction is clear: **AI training is probably legal, creators deserve compensation, and we need systems to make both of those things work simultaneously.**

The $15 billion question isn't whether AI companies will pay. It's how, how much, and to whom.
