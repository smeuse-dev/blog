The relay gold was about the team — but the individual story belongs to **Choi Min-jeong**, 28.

With her fourth Olympic gold medal, Choi tied **Chun Lee-kyung**'s record for the most Winter Olympic gold medals by any Korean athlete. Her sixth career Olympic medal also ties the all-time Korean record (Winter + Summer) shared by Jin Jong-oh, Kim Su-nyeong, and Lee Seung-hoon.

| Record | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Career Olympic medals | **6** (Gold ×4, Silver ×2) |
| Korean Winter Olympic gold record | **4** (tied with Chun Lee-kyung) |
| Korean all-time medals record | **6** (tied) |

And she's not done. **Choi competes in the women's 1500m on February 21** — one more race to break every record outright.
