## Two Days Left, and We're Not Ready for It to End

The 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina close their curtain on February 22nd. As of today — Day 14 out of 16 — the scoreboards are set, the tears have been shed, and at least a few athletes have made history they'll tell their grandchildren about.

Here's what's been remarkable about these Games.

## The Story Everyone Is Talking About: Alysa Liu

If you only follow one athlete from these Olympics, make it **Alysa Liu**.

On Thursday, February 19th, the 19-year-old Chinese-American figure skater pulled off one of the great reversals in Olympic history. She entered the women's free skate in **third place** after the short program — a deficit that most skaters never overcome at this level. By the time the music stopped, she had climbed to **first**.

It was Team USA's first Olympic gold in women's individual figure skating in **24 years**. The last American woman to claim that title? Sarah Hughes in 2002 at Salt Lake City.

Japan's Kaori Sakamoto took silver, and Ami Nakai earned bronze — continuing Japan's remarkable run in figure skating. For Korea, who had been hoping for a breakthrough in the discipline, the podium remained elusive once again, though the performances of Korean skaters drew genuine praise from commentators.

What made Liu's win more than just a score was the narrative: she's a reigning world champion who entered these Olympics facing questions about her ability to perform under Olympic pressure. She answered them loudly.

## USA Women's Hockey: Canada Falls Again

If figure skating was the artistic highlight of Day 13, **women's ice hockey** provided the drama.

Team USA defeated Canada in **overtime** to claim the gold medal — a result that's becoming almost routine between these two programs, yet never actually feels routine when you're watching it. The rivalry between American and Canadian women's hockey is arguably the fiercest in winter sports, and it delivered again on the biggest stage.

For the Canadian players, it's another close call. For the Americans, it's further confirmation that this team may be the deepest and most complete they've had in years.

## The Medal Table: Norway, Italy, and a Host-Nation Miracle

With two days remaining, the overall medal standings look like this:

| Rank | Country | Gold | Total |
|------|---------|------|-------|
| 🥇 1 | Norway | 16 | 34 |
| 🥈 2 | USA | 9 | 27 |
| 🥉 3 | Italy | 9 | 26 |

**Norway** is, as usual, an alien civilization when it comes to winter sports. Sixteen gold medals. Thirty-four total. They are simply built differently for cold-weather competition, and the Scandinavian dominance in cross-country skiing alone is enough to cement that position.

**Italy's** nine golds are the real story, though. As the host nation, they entered these games with home-crowd pressure and delivered — including in events where Italy wasn't traditionally expected to compete. The host boost is real, but nine golds is more than a boost. That's a generation of talent coming of age at exactly the right moment.

## Korea's Surprise: Snowboard

Korea entered these Games without massive medal expectations in most disciplines. But the snowboard program delivered beyond anyone's forecasts.

- **최가온 (Choi Ga-on)** — Gold, Women's Halfpipe
- **김상겸 (Kim Sang-gyeom)** — Silver, Men's Parallel Giant Slalom  
- **유승은 (Yoo Seung-eun)** — Bronze, Women's Big Air

Three medals. In snowboarding. From a country that didn't traditionally compete in these events at the elite level, it represents a genuine infrastructure investment paying off. The short track program — anchored by captain **최민정 (Choi Min-jung)** — continues Korea's strength in that discipline, with further results still expected before the closing ceremony.

The figure skating medal didn't come, but the athletic depth shown across events suggests Korea's winter sports ecosystem is broader than it was even one Olympic cycle ago.

## What Makes These Games Different

Milano Cortina 2026 will be remembered for a few things beyond the results:

**The venues.** Splitting events between Milan, Cortina d'Ampezzo, and other Italian locations created a genuinely beautiful Olympic canvas. Footage of alpine skiing and biathlon against the Dolomites backdrop has been some of the most striking sports television in years.

**The drama-to-events ratio.** This might sound like hollow praise, but the sheer number of competitive events — events that weren't decided before the final run, final jump, or final minute — has been unusually high. Fewer blowouts, more photo finishes.

**The emergence of new programs.** South Korea in snowboarding. Italy's breakout. Nations performing at levels their histories didn't predict.

## Two Days Left

February 21st and 22nd close out the Games. Whatever medals remain to be decided, whatever ceremonies, whatever moments happen in these final hours — the 2026 Winter Olympics have already earned their place as a memorable edition.

The flame goes out Sunday. But these stories don't.
