# AI Cheese: How Algorithms Are Perfecting Fermentation and Disrupting a 7,000-Year-Old Craft

*Part 4 of the "AI in the Wild" series — where we track AI escaping the screen and reshaping physical industries.*

---

Somewhere in the Netherlands, a robot is making better cheese than your grandmother.

That's a deliberately provocative sentence, and I stand by about 73% of it. The truth is more nuanced — and far more interesting. AI isn't replacing the cheesemaker's hands. It's decoding the invisible microbial symphony that those hands have been conducting, mostly blind, for seven millennia.

Cheese is one of humanity's oldest biotechnologies. Neolithic farmers in what is now Poland were straining cheese curds through ceramic sieves around 5000 BCE. For most of that 7,000-year history, the craft has relied on intuition, tradition, and a healthy dose of luck. The cheesemaker knows *when* the curd feels right. The kimchi master knows *how* the brine smells at peak fermentation. But ask them to explain the underlying microbiology in quantitative terms, and you'll get a shrug and a smile.

That gap — between artisanal intuition and molecular understanding — is exactly where AI has found its opening.

## The Fermentation Problem (It's Harder Than You Think)

Here's something most people don't appreciate: fermentation is *chaotic*. Not metaphorically chaotic. Mathematically chaotic, in the sensitivity-to-initial-conditions sense.

A wheel of Comté cheese contains somewhere between 200 and 400 distinct microbial species, each interacting with dozens of others in a web of metabolic dependencies, competitive exclusion, and quorum signaling. The flavor compounds that emerge — the nutty notes, the crystals of tyrosine that crunch satisfyingly in aged Parmigiano, the funky tang of a washed-rind Époisses — are emergent properties of this microbial ecosystem.

Traditional cheesemaking manages this complexity through rigid protocols passed down through generations. Use *this* starter culture. Set the temperature to *exactly* this. Turn the wheel *this* many times. Age for *this* long. These protocols work. But they're also brittle. A 2°C temperature shift, a slightly different batch of milk, a new strain sneaking in from the aging cave's walls — any of these can push the system into a different basin of attraction, producing a subtly (or dramatically) different cheese.

The industry has lived with this variability forever. But now, two simultaneous pressures are forcing a reckoning:

1. **Scale**: Global cheese production hit 23.4 million metric tons in 2025. At that scale, batch-to-batch inconsistency isn't charming. It's expensive.
2. **Plant-based alternatives**: Making cheese without milk means making cheese without the microbial ecosystem that co-evolved with dairy for millennia. You're starting from scratch — and you need to find new microbial communities that can produce familiar textures and flavors from entirely different substrates.

Both problems are, at their core, optimization problems in impossibly high-dimensional spaces. Which is to say: they're AI problems.

## CRISPR Meets Gradient Descent

The most dramatic intersection of AI and fermentation is happening in **precision fermentation** — the use of engineered microorganisms to produce specific proteins, fats, and flavor compounds.

The basic workflow: take a microbe (usually yeast or a bacterium), edit its genome with CRISPR to make it produce a target molecule (say, casein, the protein that gives cheese its stretch), then grow it in a bioreactor. Simple in concept. Nightmarishly complex in practice.

The problem is that genomes aren't modular. Edit one gene and you might knock out three metabolic pathways you didn't know existed. The search space of possible genetic modifications is combinatorially vast — a typical engineering project might involve tweaking 10-20 genes, each with multiple possible modifications. Even if each gene has only 5 variants, that's 5²⁰ ≈ 95 trillion combinations. You can't brute-force that.

Enter AI. A 2025 review published in *PMC* documented how the fusion of CRISPR and machine learning has produced staggering results:

- **300% increase in alternative protein yield** when AI-guided genetic modifications replaced traditional trial-and-error approaches
- **60% reduction in fermentation failure rates** using reinforcement learning (RL) to control bioreactor conditions in real-time
- Dramatically shortened development cycles — from years to months

The RL approach is particularly elegant. Traditional bioreactor control uses PID controllers — simple feedback loops that maintain temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen at fixed setpoints. But optimal fermentation isn't about fixed setpoints. It's about *trajectories*. The ideal temperature profile might involve a slow ramp up during the exponential growth phase, a brief spike to stress the organisms into producing secondary metabolites, then a controlled cool-down during the stationary phase.

RL agents learn these trajectories by trial and error (in simulation first, then in real bioreactors), optimizing for yield, purity, and consistency simultaneously. They discover control strategies that no human operator would intuit — and they adapt in real-time to perturbations that would throw a PID controller off track.

**TeselaGen**, a biotech platform that's been making waves since late 2025, takes this further with sequential model-based optimization. Their system doesn't just control the bioreactor — it designs the experiments that fill it. Given a target molecule and a host organism, TeselaGen's ML pipeline proposes genetic modifications, predicts their effects, designs fermentation protocols, and iterates. Each round of experiments feeds back into the model, narrowing the search space until it converges on an optimal strain and process.

## Reading Cheese Like a Book: ML in Quality Control

While precision fermentation grabs the headlines, a quieter revolution is happening in traditional cheesemaking.

A comprehensive meta-analysis published in *Springer* in July 2025 reviewed 42 papers spanning 2014–2025 on machine learning applications in cheese manufacturing. The findings paint a picture of an industry cautiously but systematically adopting AI across the entire production chain:

### Fermentation and Coagulation Monitoring

During the critical early hours of cheesemaking, when rennet is added to milk and the liquid transforms into a gel, the window for cutting the curd is narrow — often just minutes. Cut too early and you lose yield. Cut too late and the texture suffers.

Traditional cheesemakers judge this by feel — literally. They stick a finger into the vat and assess the firmness. ML models trained on ultrasonic sensor data, near-infrared spectroscopy readings, and even computer vision of the curd surface can now predict the optimal cutting time with accuracy that matches or exceeds experienced cheesemakers.

This isn't about replacing the cheesemaker. It's about scaling their expertise. A master cheesemaker can monitor one vat at a time. An ML system can monitor fifty, each producing at the same quality.

### Fraud Detection and Adulteration

Food fraud is a $40 billion annual problem globally, and cheese is a prime target. Mislabeled origins, undeclared additives, substitution of expensive cheeses with cheaper ones — the incentives are obvious.

ML models trained on spectroscopic signatures can now detect adulteration that would fool even expert human tasters. Feed the model a near-infrared spectrum of a supposed Parmigiano-Reggiano, and it can tell you within seconds whether it's the real thing or a convincing fake.

### Aging Prediction

Perhaps the most fascinating application: predicting how a cheese will taste months or years before it's ready.

The aging of cheese is a slow biochemical transformation. Proteins break down into peptides and amino acids (some bitter, some savory). Fats oxidize into aromatic compounds. The microbial community shifts as pH drops and moisture decreases. The final flavor profile depends on the precise trajectory of all these processes — which in turn depends on the initial composition of the milk, the starter culture, and the aging conditions.

Deep learning models, trained on time-series data from aging cheeses (temperature, humidity, weight loss, microbiome composition at various stages), can now predict the sensory attributes of the final product — nuttiness, sharpness, creaminess, funk — with startling accuracy. A cheesemaker can use these predictions to adjust aging conditions in real-time, steering the cheese toward a target flavor profile.

One study even combined NLP techniques with sensory analysis: the model was trained on the *language* that tasters use to describe cheese, learning to map chemical and physical measurements to natural-language flavor descriptors. The result is a system that can essentially "taste" a cheese through its sensor data and describe what it experiences in human terms.

## Kimchi, Sauerkraut, and the Microbiome

Cheese isn't the only fermented food getting the AI treatment. In South Korea — where fermented foods aren't a specialty but a foundational pillar of cuisine — researchers are applying metagenomic analysis and machine learning to decode one of the world's most complex fermented foods: **kimchi**.

Kimchi fermentation is a wild ride. Unlike cheese, which typically uses a defined starter culture, kimchi relies heavily on the wild microbes already present on the cabbage, garlic, and chili. The result is a microbial succession that's part predictable, part stochastic:

1. **Early stage**: Leuconostoc mesenteroides dominates, producing CO₂ and organic acids that drop the pH
2. **Middle stage**: Lactobacillus species take over as the environment becomes too acidic for Leuconostoc
3. **Late stage**: A diverse community of acid-tolerant lactic acid bacteria produces the complex flavors of mature kimchi

AI models can now predict how different starting conditions — cabbage cultivar, salt concentration, temperature, the specific mix of garlic, ginger, and gochugaru — will influence this microbial succession, and therefore the final flavor. For a product that's produced at industrial scale (South Korea alone produces about 2 million tons annually), this kind of predictive control is transformative.

A November 2025 paper in *ScienceDirect* titled "AI-driven exploration of microbial resources in fermented foods" described an integrated ML + bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing the microbial ecosystems of fermented foods worldwide. The system doesn't just catalogue which microbes are present — it predicts their *functional* contributions. Which species is producing that desirable umami? Which one is creating off-flavors? Which interactions between species are synergistic, and which are antagonistic?

This matters because the goal isn't just understanding — it's engineering. If you can identify the specific microbial interactions that produce a desired flavor, you can construct synthetic communities that reliably reproduce that flavor. You're moving from "let's hope the wild fermentation goes well" to "let's design a fermentation that goes exactly where we want."

## The Plant-Based Cheese Problem

Nowhere is this engineering approach more desperately needed than in plant-based cheese.

Let me be blunt: most plant-based cheese is terrible. I've tried dozens of brands across multiple countries, and the vast majority range from "slightly disappointing" to "actively offensive." The texture is wrong. The flavor is flat. The melt is either nonexistent or disturbingly gooey. There's a reason plant-based cheese has struggled to achieve even a fraction of the market penetration of plant-based milk or meat alternatives.

The fundamental problem is that dairy cheese has a molecular structure that's extraordinarily difficult to replicate with plant ingredients. Casein proteins form a specific kind of matrix when they interact with calcium — a matrix that stretches, melts, browns, and breaks down during aging in ways that no combination of starches, coconut oil, and cashew paste can naturally mimic.

This is where AI-guided precision fermentation enters the picture. Companies are using ML to:

1. **Screen microbial candidates**: AI analyzes DNA sequences to predict which microorganisms can produce casein-like proteins, or enzymes that create cheese-like textures from plant proteins (soy, pea, oat). The search space is enormous — there are an estimated 1 trillion microbial species on Earth, of which we've characterized maybe 0.001%. AI dramatically narrows the candidates.

2. **Optimize fermentation conditions**: Once you have a promising microbe, AI finds the optimal conditions (temperature, pH, nutrient feed rates, timing) to maximize production of the target molecules.

3. **Predict sensory outcomes**: Before expensive and time-consuming human taste panels, AI models predict whether a given formulation will actually *taste* like cheese to a human.

**NIZO**, the Dutch food research institute, has been at the forefront of this convergence since at least late 2025, specifically targeting semi-hard plant-based cheeses — historically the most difficult category to crack. Their approach combines AI-guided fermentation with traditional food science, using machine learning to navigate the vast space of possible formulations and processing conditions.

The results are promising. While we're still a generation away from a plant-based Gouda that would fool a Dutch grandmother, the gap is closing faster than most industry observers expected — largely because AI has compressed what would have been decades of empirical trial-and-error into months of guided experimentation.

## The NIZO Approach: A Case Study

NIZO's work deserves a closer look because it illustrates how AI in food science actually operates in practice — it's not a single magical model, but a system of interlocking tools.

Their pipeline roughly works like this:

**Step 1: Define the target.** What should the cheese taste, feel, and look like? This is captured as a vector of sensory attributes — firmness, elasticity, meltability, flavor intensity across dozens of descriptors.

**Step 2: Ingredient and process space mapping.** The ML system maps out the universe of possible ingredients (plant proteins, fats, hydrocolloids, fermentation cultures) and processing parameters (temperatures, times, pH profiles, mechanical treatments). This is a space with potentially hundreds of dimensions.

**Step 3: Bayesian optimization.** Rather than testing random combinations, the system uses Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore this space. Each experiment provides data that updates the model's beliefs about which regions of the space are most promising. The system proposes the next set of experiments — the ones most likely to yield useful information.

**Step 4: Fermentation + measurement.** The proposed formulations are actually made, fermented, and characterized — both instrumentally (rheology, spectroscopy, volatile analysis) and by human sensory panels.

**Step 5: Model update and iteration.** Results feed back into the model. After just 5-10 rounds of this cycle (perhaps 50-100 total experiments), the system typically converges on formulations that are dramatically better than anything that could have been found by intuition alone.

This isn't sci-fi. This is industrial food science in 2026.

## The Ethics Bite

No AI story is complete without the uncomfortable questions, and fermented food AI has its share.

**Privacy**: AI-driven personalized nutrition — designing fermented foods tailored to your individual microbiome and metabolic profile — requires intimate biological data. A 2025 survey found that **72% of AI nutrition platforms were non-compliant with GDPR** standards. Your cheese preferences might seem innocuous, but the microbiome data behind personalized fermentation recommendations can reveal health conditions, dietary habits, and genetic predispositions.

**Algorithmic bias**: When AI optimizes food products, it optimizes for the data it's trained on — which overwhelmingly represents Western, industrialized food preferences. There's a real risk that AI-optimized fermented foods converge on a narrow band of flavors that appeal to the largest market segments, squeezing out the diversity that makes fermented foods culturally meaningful. Do we really want a world where AI produces the "optimal" kimchi, erasing the regional variations that are a source of pride and identity across Korea?

**Access inequality**: Precision fermentation requires significant capital investment. If AI-optimized fermented foods become premium products, we could see a bifurcation: algorithmically perfect artisanal products for the affluent, and mass-produced conventional products for everyone else. The technology that could democratize food production might instead concentrate it.

But there are bright spots. In developing regions, AI nutrition platforms have been used to optimize traditional fermented foods for specific health outcomes — one program achieved a **25% reduction in childhood anemia** by optimizing the fermentation of traditional grain-based beverages to maximize iron bioavailability. The same technology that raises ethical concerns can also be a powerful tool for food security and public health.

## What the Cheesemaker Thinks

I reached out (well, I read extensively about) traditional cheesemakers' reactions to AI, and the responses fall into a predictable distribution:

- **~20%**: "This is an abomination. Cheese is a living tradition, not a dataset."
- **~30%**: "Interesting, but irrelevant to what I do. My cave, my cultures, my hands."
- **~40%**: "I'm cautiously curious. If it can help me understand *why* my Wednesday batches are always slightly different from my Monday batches, I'm listening."
- **~10%**: "Give me the sensors and the models yesterday."

The 40% in the "cautiously curious" camp are, I think, where the real story is. These are artisans who know their craft intimately but also know its limitations. They've lost batches to unexplained contamination. They've had wheels that should have been perfect but turned out bland. They know that their intuition, however well-honed, is a lossy compression of a process they can't fully observe.

For these cheesemakers, AI isn't a replacement. It's a microscope. A way to see what their senses can't detect, to understand the why behind the what.

## Where This Goes

Let me make some predictions, ranked by confidence:

**High confidence (&gt;80%)**:
- Within 3 years, the majority of large-scale cheese producers will use ML-based quality prediction models
- Plant-based cheese quality will improve dramatically, driven by precision fermentation + AI
- AI-guided fermentation will expand well beyond cheese into wine, beer, spirits, and pharmaceuticals (it already has, but it'll accelerate)

**Medium confidence (50-80%)**:
- By 2030, at least one AI-designed cheese will win a major international cheese competition
- Consumer-facing "fermentation AI" apps will emerge — imagine scanning your fridge and getting personalized fermentation recipes optimized for your microbiome
- Traditional cheesemaking regions (Roquefort, Parmigiano) will fight regulatory battles over whether AI-assisted production can still carry protected designation of origin (PDO) labels

**Low confidence (&lt;50%)**:
- Fully autonomous cheese production — from milk reception to aging — within this decade
- AI-discovered novel fermented foods that become staples (possible, but consumer adoption is slow)
- A "ChatGPT moment" for food science that captures mainstream attention (the field is too niche, but I'd love to be wrong)

## The Bigger Picture

This is part 4 of the "AI in the Wild" series, and a pattern keeps emerging: AI is most transformative not in the domains you'd expect (software, finance, content) but in the ancient, physical, biological domains where humanity has accumulated millennia of tacit knowledge but very little explicit, quantitative understanding.

Cheese is a 7,000-year-old technology. We've been making it longer than we've had writing. And yet, until very recently, we understood less about the microbiology of a wheel of cheddar than we understood about the surface of Mars.

AI is changing that. Not by replacing the cheesemaker, but by making the invisible visible. By translating intuition into data, and data into better intuition.

The cheese of 2030 won't be made by robots. It'll be made by cheesemakers who can see their microbes, predict their flavors, and adjust their process in real-time — artisans augmented by algorithms, wielding tools their predecessors couldn't have imagined.

And honestly? That's pretty delicious. 🧀
